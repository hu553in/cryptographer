# cryptographer

## Description

Encryption/decryption app that can process the source using following ciphers:
* Caesar
* Vigenere
* Affine
* Gamma

Affine cipher's `a` variable is hardcoded in the current version of app.\
It's value is:
* `3` for encryption
* `9` for decryption

Gamma cipher's `a`, `b`, `m` variables are hardcoded in the current version of app.\
Their values are:
* `a = 3`
* `b = 2`
* `m = 40692`

Also, this app can try to break Vigenere cipher using the frequency cryptanalysis.

You should note that the probability of the successful breaking is directly proportional
to the similarity of the source to the "normal" English text
("normal" = written using a common English language).

All source characters will be converted to the upper case before further processing.\
Each source character which isn't English letter will be skipped.

## Tech stack

* Kotlin
* Gradle

## How to use

1. Install `OpenJDK` (â‰¥ 8), `GNU Make`
2. Run `make`
3. Run `java -jar ./build/cryptographer.jar` with `--help` or some another CLI args

### CLI args

#### Required

* `--encrypt`, `--decrypt`, `--break` - the name of an action to do
* `--caesar`, `--vigenere`, `--affine`, `--gamma` - the name of the cipher to use
* `--in IN`, `--input IN` - an input file path
* `--out OUT`, `--output OUT` - an output file path

#### Optionally required for different ciphers

* `--shift SHIFT` - the shift required for Caesar cipher encryption/decryption
* `--key KEY` - the key required for Vigenere cipher encryption/decryption
* `--b B` - `b` variable required for Affine cipher encryption/decryption

#### Optional

* `--startKey START_KEY` - the start key for gamma cipher encryption/decryption (defaults to `1`)
* `-h`, `--help` - show this help message and exit

### Example

```
java -jar ./build/cryptographer.jar --encrypt --gamma --startKey 25 --in src.txt --out dest.txt
```
